# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focusing on data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and deriving insights from a given dataset. The project demonstrates the use of various data analysis tools and techniques to extract meaningful information and support decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Exploration**: Summarizing and visualizing the data to understand its structure.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs to represent data insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to analyze data trends and patterns.
- **Reporting**: Generating a detailed report of findings and insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Library for statistical data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running and documenting code.
